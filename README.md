### introduction  
Hi,  

I am Kai-Yin Huang, a dedicated graduate student currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology and Analytics at Rutgers University. My academic journey has fueled my passion for continuous learning, which drives me to explore new knowledge areas, such as self-studying front-end web design and cloud technologies.

In addition to my commitment to learning, I excel in collaborative projects and have a knack for taking on the role of a coordinator within teams. This ability to facilitate communication and bring a unique perspective to the group has consistently added value to the teams I work with.

Drawing from my past learning experiences and project work, I have acquired a diverse skill set. I am proficient in various programming languages, including Python, SQL, and R. Furthermore, I possess expertise in data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau, as well as advanced data analysis using Excel. This versatility allows me to adapt to a wide range of tasks and challenges.

My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, contributing to an organization that values innovation and data-driven decision-making. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my expertise to real-world problems and make a meaningful impact.

Best,  
Kai-Yin Huang
